## PingifyMe: Monitor Network Connectivity with Ease

PingifyMe is a user-friendly desktop application written in C# (.NET 8) for Windows Forms. It empowers you to continuously monitor the ping response of one or multiple IP addresses, providing valuable insights into your network health.

**Features:**

* **Effortless Multi-IP Pinging:** Specify a list of IP addresses (no limit!) and initiate continuous pinging with a user-defined interval (default: 1 second).
* **Detailed Ping Results:** Gain valuable insights with comprehensive results displayed in a dedicated log area. Each entry includes the timestamp, replying IP address, response time, data size, and Time To Live (TTL) value.
* **Stop and Export:** Take control of the monitoring process. Pause pinging at any time and choose to export the entire log as a text file for further analysis or documentation.

**Benefits:**

* **Simple and Efficient:** PingifyMe offers a straightforward interface, making it easy to monitor network connectivity and identify potential performance issues.
* **Customizable Monitoring:** Tailor the monitoring process to your specific needs. Ping multiple IP addresses simultaneously and adjust the ping interval for optimal results.
